### `npm start` Start the app

### `npm test` Test the app

This app is a to upload quotes, show them, and comment them. Everything is stored in the Firebase real time database.

React is the framework used to create this app, which has two custom hooks, one for the http requests (retrieve and store the data, such as quotes and comments) and another one for the inputs and validation.

React router is used to navigate through the different pages, and a nice loading spinner was created with css keyframes for the loading periods to elevate the user experience.

I also added a sorting function, using sort and map JS methods.
